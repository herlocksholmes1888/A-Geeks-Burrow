Are you a life-long learner? Are you haunted by multiple interests? Above all else, do you think that the opinion of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, matter at all?

If so, welcome to **A Geek's Burrow**, a place where I lose track of my mind as an attempt to build an online presence. Here, you will find articles that cover a vast array of topics: from Computer Science to Literature, from language learning to philosophical reflections... the one thing I can assure you is that all topics will inevitably touch a subject in the geek world!

## 📝 About the project
**A Geek's Burrow** started off as a challenge from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. I've allowed myself to add a couple of complexities to keep the challenge fresh. I intend on using the platform as my go-to writing spot when I venture myself in the writing of online articles, rather than using Medium.

[Here's the prototype I made on Figma!](https://www.figma.com/design/9JL3E20K2HAychTQUmxYea/A-Geek's-Burrow?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=CaF7cN6n1p4gTLb3-0). For those who have been here since the beginning, [here's the original design](https://www.figma.com/design/Xppsg76PikexYXjKSAtsQN/Geek's-Burrow?node-id=1-2&node-type=canvas&t=EST6BTrFXrmmE53q-0). Talk about a glow up!

If you want to see how the Frontend is looking thus far, [check it out on this Pages website](https://herlocksholmes1888.github.io/A-Geeks-Burrow-FRONTEND/)!

## 💾 Let's get technical
Here's the technologies that make **A Geek's Burrow** run:

* EJS and HTML, for the skeleton of the website;
* Vanilla CSS, so it isn't horrendous to look at;
* JavaScript, NodeJS and Express, for all the pesky programming part;
* MongoDB, so there actually is content to be read.

I've tried to keep the project as simple as it could possibly be. It marks my first attempt at a Fullstack application, rather than a Frontend one.

As a Fullstack application, **A Geek's Burrow** will run on Vercel. I shall add a link both in the repo's link section *and* in the file you are currently reading once the project reaches deployment stage.
